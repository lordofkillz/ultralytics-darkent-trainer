I am proud to share that I have developed a highly efficient project designed to facilitate the training of object detection models using darknet YOLO .weights and Ultralytics .py weights. The project is equipped with a comprehensive configuration file (cfg) and YAML parser, which make it incredibly easy to customize and tweak settings to meet individual needs. Additionally, it boasts a powerful feature that enables it to automatically calculate anchors in darknet and create all required train files with ease, simply by creating a .txt file.

This project is a valuable tool for those seeking to develop sophisticated object detection models that can be applied to a wide range of real-world scenarios, including security and surveillance systems, autonomous vehicles, and robotics.

If you have any questions or need further information, please do not hesitate to ask. I am eager to help and provide any assistance you may need.
1. create an anaconda/minconda env 
2. install ultralytics
3.install cuda and cudnn
4. install darknet 
must have these things installed to use the script.
its still a work in progress so adding new featues everyday.
